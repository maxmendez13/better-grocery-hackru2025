Entry for HackRU Spring 2025 by Max Mendez including a software that simulates a solution for a better shopping experience for customers.
Track: Maverick
Bounties: Wakefern Food Challenge, Best Solo Hack


Have you ever gotten lost in a grocery store and felt like you've wandered for hours before either finding an employee to ask or giving up altogether?
This has happened to me more than I'd like to admit. I have also worked at ShopRite in the past and found so many people confused about which aisles have what items.

For HackRU Spring 2025 I decided to create a shopping list solution that would generate a list of the shopper's desired items based on the location of the store
and when they should optimally be picked up. This makes it so shoppers aren't walking back and forth across large supermarkets unsure of where the items they need are.
This is also a perfect solution for shoppers who plan in advance what items they need to get so they are prepared for their shopping experience!

I used Python to complete this project, creating fake data sets for products using dictionaries inside of lists. Ideally, I would have used a database with multiple tables
but I was unable to figure out/finish in time. More details of the process located in the scrap.txt file.

All the code is my own with some minor help of Python documentation taken from W3Schools and GeeksForGeeks
